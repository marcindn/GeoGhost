GeoGhost - Browser Fingerprint Protection

Core Purpose: GeoGhost is a privacy-focused browser extension designed to combat online tracking by actively spoofing your digital fingerprint and location data. It provides comprehensive protection against browser fingerprinting techniques used by websites to identify and track users across sessions.
How It Works

Digital Fingerprint Spoofing System:

    Profile-Based Masking:

        Uses 9 pre-configured country profiles (Germany, US, Japan, etc.)

        Dynamically replaces your real browser identifiers with profile-specific values

        Spoofs: User agent, screen resolution, color depth, hardware concurrency, device memory

    Location Protection:

        Simulates GPS coordinates matching selected country profile

        Overrides geolocation API requests

        Masks IP-based location detection through Tor routing

    Tor Network Integration:

        Routes all browser traffic through local Tor client

        Uses SOCKS proxy on port 9050 (configurable)

        Provides multi-layer encryption and IP anonymization

    Privacy Maintenance Tools:

        Automatic cookie scanning and cleaning

        Session isolation techniques

        Timezone synchronization with selected profile

Key Technical Components:

    Manifest V3 Compliance: Uses modern browser extension architecture

    API Overriding: Hooks into navigator, screen, and device APIs

    Proxy Management: Handles traffic routing through Tor

    Content Scripts: Injects privacy protections into visited pages

    Configuration System: JSON-based settings management

Installation Requirements

Firefox:

    Install Tor client locally

    Set xpinstall.signatures.required = false in about:config

    Disable privacy.resistFingerprinting for full functionality

Chrome/Edge:

    Requires developer mode activation

    No external dependencies beyond extension files

Usage Workflow

    Activation:

        Click toolbar icon

        Select country profile

        Verify green status indicator

    Verification:

        Run fingerprint test at sites like amiunique.org

        Confirm location spoofing at browserleaks.com/geo

    Maintenance:

        Automatic cookie cleaning (when enabled)

        Manual session reset via extension UI

Configuration Options

geoghost.conf.json parameters:
json

{
  "default_profile": "japan",  // Pre-selected country
  "tor_port": 9150,            // Custom Tor port
  "auto_clean": false,          // Cookie auto-clean
  "hardware_spoofing": true,    // GPU/RAM masking
  "tz_sync": "profile"         // Timezone handling
}

Limitations & Notes

    Firefox-Specific:

        Requires manual Tor installation

        Timezone updates may need page refresh

        Conflicts with native fingerprint resistance

    General Considerations:

        May break location-sensitive websites

        Some WebRTC features might be limited

        Performance impact during Tor routing

    Security Compliance:

        No data collection by extension

        Local processing only (no remote servers)

        Open-source verification through GitHub

This comprehensive protection system allows users to browse with significantly reduced tracking exposure while maintaining control over their digital identity across websites. The combination of fingerprint spoofing, location masking, and Tor integration creates multiple layers of privacy protection against both common and advanced tracking techniques.
